## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### Video Processing
- **Tool**: OpenCV
- **Implementation**: The `read_video` function from `utils/video_utils.py` reads the input video and extracts frames for further analysis.

### Object Detection
- **Tool**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Implementation**: YOLOv8 is used for detecting players and the tennis ball in each frame. The models are fine-tuned on a custom dataset of tennis images.

### Keypoint Detection
- **Tool**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Implementation**: A custom CNN model is used to detect keypoints of the tennis court in the video frames.

### Tracking
- **Tool**: SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)
- **Implementation**: SORT is used for tracking the detected players and ball across frames.

### Data Visualization
- **Tool**: Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Implementation**: Matplotlib is used for plotting ball positions and calculating rolling means. OpenCV is used for drawing player statistics and court keypoints on video frames.

### Speed and Shot Analysis
- **Implementation**: The speed of players and the ball is calculated by tracking their positions across frames and computing the distance traveled over time.

### Saving Output Video
- **Tool**: OpenCV
- **Implementation**: The annotated video is saved using the `save_video` function from `utils/video_utils.py`.
